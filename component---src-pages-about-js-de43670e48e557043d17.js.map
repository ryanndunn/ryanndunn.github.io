With over ten years of professional experience, I’ve had the opportunity to build award-winning websites and lead frontend initiatives at Duckpin, where I specialize in React and WordPress.</p>\n        <p>My modern frontend workflows are all aimed at solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code. I believe the web experiences that the world deserves are streamlined for performance, accessible and intuitive enough so anyone can use it.</p>\n        <p>My parents are small business owners, and that’s shaped the way I approach my career — with humility, hard work, and a focus on the people behind the project. Whether I'm building tools for a local shop or scaling experiences for larger audiences, I aim to create work that’s impactful, thoughtful, and lasting. Outside of work, I play music and chess, both of which keep my mind sharp and carry through to my development work.</p>\n        <p>Web development is a part of who I am - it keeps me focused and gives me a sense of community fulfillment that I have not found with anything else.</p>\n      </div>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const Head = () => <Seo title=\"About\" />\nexport default AboutPage"],"names":["Head","title","pageContainerClass","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
